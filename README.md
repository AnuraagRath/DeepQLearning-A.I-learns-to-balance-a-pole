# DeepQLearning-A.I-learns-to-balance-a-pole
Using Deep Q Learning, The Reinforcement 'Q' learning model is used along with a Neural Network to provide optimal 'q' function values i.e the optimal 'Actions' for the 'Agent' to undergo at a given time to balance a pole. The Deep-Q-Network is created using Pytorch. This is a base model which is to be improved upon.
